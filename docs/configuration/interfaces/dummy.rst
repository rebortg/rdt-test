Dummy

The dummy interface is really a little exotic, but rather useful nevertheless.
Dummy interfaces are much like the :ref:`loopback-interface` interface, except
you can have as many as you want.

.. note:: Dummy interfaces can be used as interfaces that always stay up (in
   the same fashion to loopbacks in Cisco IOS), or for testing purposes.

.. hint:: On systems with multiple redundant uplinks and routes,
   it's a good idea to use a dedicated address for management and dynamic routing protocols.
   However, assigning that address to a physical link is risky:
   if that link goes down, that address will become inaccessible.
   A common solution is to assign the management address to a loopback or a dummy interface
   and advertise that address via all physical links, so that it's reachable
   through any of them. Since in Linux-based systems, there can be only one loopback interface,
   it's better to use a dummy interface for that purpose, since they can be added, removed,
   and taken up and down independently.
