Tunnel
======

This article touches on 'classic' IP tunneling protocols.

GRE is often seen as a one size fits all solution when it comes to classic IP
tunneling protocols, and for a good reason. However, there are more specialized
options, and many of them are supported by VyOS. There are also rather obscure
GRE options that can be useful.

All those protocols are grouped under ``interfaces tunnel`` in VyOS. Let's take
a closer look at the protocols and options currently supported by VyOS.

Common interface configuration
------------------------------

.. cmdinclude:: /_include/interface-common-without-dhcp.txt
   :var0: tunnel
   :var1: tun0

IPIP
----

This is one of the simplest types of tunnels, as defined by :rfc:`2003`.
It takes an IPv4 packet and sends it as a payload of another IPv4 packet. For
this reason, there are no other configuration options for this kind of tunnel.

An example:

.. code-block:: none

  set interfaces tunnel tun0 encapsulation ipip
  set interfaces tunnel tun0 source-address 192.0.2.10
  set interfaces tunnel tun0 remote 203.0.113.20
  set interfaces tunnel tun0 address 192.168.100.200/24

IP6IP6
------

This is the IPv6 counterpart of IPIP. I'm not aware of an RFC that defines this
encapsulation specifically, but it's a natural specific case of IPv6
encapsulation mechanisms described in :rfc:2473`.

It's not likely that anyone will need it any time soon, but it does exist.

An example:

.. code-block:: none

  set interfaces tunnel tun0 encapsulation ip6ip6
  set interfaces tunnel tun0 source-address 2001:db8:aa::1
  set interfaces tunnel tun0 remote 2001:db8:aa::2
  set interfaces tunnel tun0 address 2001:db8:bb::1/64

IPIP6
-----

In the future this is expected to be a very useful protocol (though there are
`other proposals`_).

As the name implies, it's IPv4 encapsulated in IPv6, as simple as that.

An example:

.. code-block:: none

  set interfaces tunnel tun0 encapsulation ipip6
  set interfaces tunnel tun0 source-address 2001:db8:aa::1
  set interfaces tunnel tun0 remote 2001:db8:aa::2
  set interfaces tunnel tun0 address 192.168.70.80/24

6in4 (SIT)
----------

6in4 uses tunneling to encapsulate IPv6 traffic over IPv4 links as defined in
:rfc:`4213`. The 6in4 traffic is sent over IPv4 inside IPv4 packets whose IP
headers have the IP protocol number set to 41. This protocol number is
specifically designated for IPv6 encapsulation, the IPv4 packet header is
immediately followed by the IPv6 packet being carried. The encapsulation
overhead is the size of the IPv4 header of 20 bytes, therefore with an MTU of
1500 bytes, IPv6 packets of 1480 bytes can be sent without fragmentation. This
tunneling technique is frequently used by IPv6 tunnel brokers like `Hurricane
Electric`_.

An example:

.. code-block:: none

  set interfaces tunnel tun0 encapsulation sit
  set interfaces tunnel tun0 source-address 192.0.2.10
  set interfaces tunnel tun0 remote 192.0.2.20
  set interfaces tunnel tun0 address 2001:db8:bb::1/64

A full example of a Tunnelbroker.net config can be found at
:ref:`here <examples-tunnelbroker-ipv6>`.

Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)
-----------------------------------

A GRE tunnel operates at layer 3 of the OSI model and is represented by IP
protocol 47. The main benefit of a GRE tunnel is that you are able to carry
multiple protocols inside the same tunnel. GRE also supports multicast traffic
and supports routing protocols that leverage multicast to form neighbor
adjacencies.

A VyOS GRE tunnel can carry both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic and can also be created
over either IPv4 (gre) or IPv6 (ip6gre).


Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A basic configuration requires a tunnel source (source-address), a tunnel
destination (remote), an encapsulation type (gre), and an address (ipv4/ipv6).
Below is a basic IPv4 only configuration example taken from a VyOS router and
a Cisco IOS router. The main difference between these two configurations is
that VyOS requires you explicitly configure the encapsulation type. The Cisco
router defaults to GRE IP otherwise it would have to be configured as well.

**VyOS Router:**

.. code-block:: none

  set interfaces tunnel tun100 address '10.0.0.1/30'
  set interfaces tunnel tun100 encapsulation 'gre'
  set interfaces tunnel tun100 source-address '198.51.100.2'
  set interfaces tunnel tun100 remote '203.0.113.10'

**Cisco IOS Router:**

.. code-block:: none

  interface Tunnel100
  ip address 10.0.0.2 255.255.255.252
  tunnel source 203.0.113.10
  tunnel destination 198.51.100.2

Here is a second example of a dual-stack tunnel over IPv6 between a VyOS router
and a Linux host using systemd-networkd.

**VyOS Router:**

.. code-block:: none

  set interfaces tunnel tun101 address '2001:db8:feed:beef::1/126'
  set interfaces tunnel tun101 address '192.168.5.1/30'
  set interfaces tunnel tun101 encapsulation 'ip6gre'
  set interfaces tunnel tun101 source-address '2001:db8:babe:face::3afe:3'
  set interfaces tunnel tun101 remote '2001:db8:9bb:3ce::5'

**Linux systemd-networkd:**

This requires two files, one to create the device (XXX.netdev) and one
to configure the network on the device (XXX.network)

.. code-block:: none

  # cat /etc/systemd/network/gre-example.netdev
  [NetDev]
  Name=gre-example
  Kind=ip6gre
  MTUBytes=14180

  [Tunnel]
  Remote=2001:db8:babe:face::3afe:3


  # cat /etc/systemd/network/gre-example.network
  [Match]
  Name=gre-example

  [Network]
  Address=2001:db8:feed:beef::2/126

  [Address]
  Address=192.168.5.2/30

Tunnel keys
^^^^^^^^^^^

GRE is also the only classic protocol that allows creating multiple tunnels
with the same source and destination due to its support for tunnel keys.
Despite its name, this feature has nothing to do with security: it's simply
an identifier that allows routers to tell one tunnel from another.

An example:

.. code-block:: none

   set interfaces tunnel tun0 source-address 192.0.2.10
   set interfaces tunnel tun0 remote 192.0.2.20
   set interfaces tunnel tun0 address 10.40.50.60/24
   set interfaces tunnel tun0 parameters ip key 10

.. code-block:: none

   set interfaces tunnel tun0 source-address 192.0.2.10
   set interfaces tunnel tun0 remote 192.0.2.20
   set interfaces tunnel tun0 address 172.16.17.18/24
   set interfaces tunnel tun0 parameters ip key 20

GRETAP
^^^^^^^

While normal GRE is for layer 3, GRETAP is for layer 2. GRETAP can encapsulate
Ethernet frames, thus it can be bridged with other interfaces to create 
datalink layer segments that span multiple remote sites.

.. code-block:: none

   set interfaces bridge br0 member interface eth0
   set interfaces bridge br0 member interface tun0
   set interfaces tunnel tun0 encapsulation gretap
   set interfaces tunnel tun0 source-address 198.51.100.2
   set interfaces tunnel tun0 remote 203.0.113.10


Troubleshooting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

GRE is a well defined standard that is common in most networks. While not
inherently difficult to configure there are a couple of things to keep in mind
to make sure the configuration performs as expected. A common cause for GRE
tunnels to fail to come up correctly include ACL or Firewall configurations
that are discarding IP protocol 47 or blocking your source/destination traffic.

**1. Confirm IP connectivity between tunnel source-address and remote:**

.. code-block:: none

  vyos@vyos:~$ ping 203.0.113.10 interface 198.51.100.2 count 4
  PING 203.0.113.10 (203.0.113.10) from 198.51.100.2 : 56(84) bytes of data.
  64 bytes from 203.0.113.10: icmp_seq=1 ttl=254 time=0.807 ms
  64 bytes from 203.0.113.10: icmp_seq=2 ttl=254 time=1.50 ms
  64 bytes from 203.0.113.10: icmp_seq=3 ttl=254 time=0.624 ms
  64 bytes from 203.0.113.10: icmp_seq=4 ttl=254 time=1.41 ms

  --- 203.0.113.10 ping statistics ---
  4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss, time 3007ms
  rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.624/1.087/1.509/0.381 ms

**2. Confirm the link type has been set to GRE:**

.. code-block:: none

  vyos@vyos:~$ show interfaces tunnel tun100
  tun100@NONE: <POINTOPOINT,NOARP,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1476 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/gre 198.51.100.2 peer 203.0.113.10
    inet 10.0.0.1/30 brd 10.0.0.3 scope global tun100
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fe80::5efe:c612:2/64 scope link
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

    RX:  bytes    packets     errors    dropped    overrun      mcast
          2183         27          0          0          0          0
    TX:  bytes    packets     errors    dropped    carrier collisions
           836          9          0          0          0          0

**3. Confirm IP connectivity across the tunnel:**

.. code-block:: none

  vyos@vyos:~$ ping 10.0.0.2 interface 10.0.0.1 count 4
  PING 10.0.0.2 (10.0.0.2) from 10.0.0.1 : 56(84) bytes of data.
  64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_seq=1 ttl=255 time=1.05 ms
  64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_seq=2 ttl=255 time=1.88 ms
  64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_seq=3 ttl=255 time=1.98 ms
  64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_seq=4 ttl=255 time=1.98 ms

  --- 10.0.0.2 ping statistics ---
  4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss, time 3008ms
  rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 1.055/1.729/1.989/0.395 ms

.. note:: There is also a GRE over IPv6 encapsulation available, it is
  called: ``ip6gre``.
