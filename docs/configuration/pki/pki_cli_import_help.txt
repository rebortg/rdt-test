.. note:: In addition to the command above, the output is in a format which can
  be used to directly import the key into the VyOS CLI by simply copy-pasting
  the output from op-mode into configuration mode.

  ``name`` is used for the VyOS CLI command to identify this key. This
  key ``name`` is then used in the CLI configuration to reference the key
  instance.
