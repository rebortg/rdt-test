   disable-flow-control

  Ethernet flow control is a mechanism for temporarily stopping the transmission
  of data on Ethernet family computer networks. The goal of this mechanism is to
  ensure zero packet loss in the presence of network congestion.

  The first flow control mechanism, the pause frame, was defined by the IEEE
  802.3x standard.

  A sending station (computer or network switch) may be transmitting data faster
  than the other end of the link can accept it. Using flow control, the
  receiving station can signal the sender requesting suspension of
  transmissions until the receiver catches up.

  Use this command to disable the generation of Ethernet flow control (pause
  frames).

   Example:

   .. code-block:: none

     set interfaces {{ var0 }} {{ var1 }} {{ var2 }} {{ var4 }} disable-flow-control
