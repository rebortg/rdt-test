":abbr:`MPLS (Multi-Protocol Label Switching)` is a packet forwarding "
"paradigm which differs from regular IP forwarding. Instead of IP "
"addresses being used to make the decision on finding the exit interface, "
"a router will instead use an exact match on a 32 bit/4 byte header called"
" the MPLS label. This label is inserted between the ethernet (layer 2) "
"header and the IP (layer 3) header. One can statically or dynamically "
"assign label allocations, but we will focus on dynamic allocation of "
"labels using some sort of label distribution protocol (such as the aptly "
"named Label Distribution Protocol / LDP, Resource Reservation Protocol / "
"RSVP, or Segment Routing through OSPF/ISIS). These protocols allow for "
"the creation of a unidirectional/unicast path called a labeled switched "
"path (initialized as LSP) throughout the network that operates very much "
"like a tunnel through the network. An easy way of thinking about how an "
"MPLS LSP actually forwards traffic throughout a network is to think of a "
"GRE tunnel. They are not the same in how they operate, but they are the "
"same in how they handle the tunneled packet. It would be good to think of"
" MPLS as a tunneling technology that can be used to transport many "
"different types of packets, to aid in traffic engineering by allowing one"
" to specify paths throughout the network (using RSVP or SR), and to "
"generally allow for easier intra/inter network transport of data packets."
