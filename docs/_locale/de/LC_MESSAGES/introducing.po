"VyOS provides a free routing platform that competes directly with other "
"commercially available solutions from well known network providers. "
"Because VyOS runs on standard amd64, i586 and ARM systems, it is able to "
"be used as a router and firewall platform for cloud deployments."

"We use multiple live versions of our manual, hosted thankfully by "

"VyOS CLI syntax may change between major (and sometimes minor) versions. "

"action needs to be taken by you."

"There once was a network operating system based on Debian GNU/Linux, "
"called Vyatta. [*]_ 2006 onwards, it was a great free software "
"alternative to Cisco IOS and Jupiter JUNOS. It came in two editions: "
"Vyatta Core (previously Vyatta Community Edition) that was completely "
"free software, and Vyatta Subscription Edition that had proprietary "
"features and was only available to paying customers. [*]_"

#: ../../introducing/history.rst:17
msgid ""
"Vyatta was acquired by Brocade Communication Systems in 2012. Shortly "
"after, Brocade renamed Vyatta Subscription Edition to Brocade vRouter, "
"discontinued Vyatta Core and shut down the community forum without a "
"notice. The bug tracker and Git repositories followed next year."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introducing/history.rst:22
msgid ""
"It's worth noting that by the time Brocade acquired Vyatta, development "
"of Vyatta Core was already stagnated. Vyatta Subscription Edition (and "
"thus, Vyatta development as a whole) had been replacing core components "
"with proprietary software, meaning few features made it to Vyatta Core, "
"and those that did were bug-ridden and hamstrung."

msgid ""
"In 2013, soon after Vyatta Core was abandoned, the community forked the "
"last Vyatta Core version (6.6R1) and VyOS Project came into being. "
"`Sentrium SL <https://blog.vyos.io/sentrium-what-sentrium>`_ was "
"established by VyOS maintainers in 2014 to fund VyOS development by "
"selling support, consulting services and prebuilt long-term support "

"Released just in time for holidays on 22 December 2013, Hydrogen was the "

"Core 6.6 (such as IPv4 BGP peer groups and DHCPv6 relay) and introduced "

"Helium was released on 9 October 2014, exactly on the day VyOS Project "
"first came into being in the previous year. Helium came with a lot of new"
" features, including an event handler and support for L2TPv3, 802.1ad "
"QinQ and IGMP proxy, as well as experimental support for VXLAN and DMVPN "

"Although Crux came with too many new features to mention here, some "
"noteworthy ones are: an mDNS repeater, a broadcast relay, a high-"
"performance PPPoE server, an HFSC scheduler, as well as support for "
"Wireguard, unicast VRRP, RPKI for BGP and fully 802.1ad-compliant QinQ "

"Crux is the first version to feature the modular image build system. CLI "
