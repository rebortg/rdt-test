"performance. The VyOS system supports a “RAID 1” deployment. RAID 1 "
"allows two or more disks to mirror one another to provide system fault "
"tolerance. In a RAID 1 solution, every sector of one disk is duplicated "
"onto every sector of all disks in the array. Provided even one disk in "
"the RAID 1 set is operational, the system continues to run, even through "
"disk replacement (provided that the hardware supports in-service "
"replacement of drives). RAID 1 can be implemented using special hardware "
"or it can be implemented in software. The VyOS system supports software "
