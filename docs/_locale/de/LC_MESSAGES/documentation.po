msgstr ""

#: ../../documentation.rst:60
msgid ""
"The Forking Workflow is fundamentally different from other popular Git "
"workflows. Instead of using a single server-side repository to act as the"
" \"central\" codebase, it gives every developer their own server-side "
"repository. This means that each contributor has not one, but two Git "
"repositories: a private local one and a public server-side one."
msgstr ""

#: ../../documentation.rst:66
msgid ""
"The main advantage of the Forking Workflow is that contributions can be "
"integrated without the need for everybody to push to a single central "
"repository. Developers push to their own server-side repositories, and "
"only the project maintainer can push to the official repository. This "
"allows the maintainer to accept commits from any developer without giving"
" them write access to the official codebase."
